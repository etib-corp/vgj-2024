	- What do you need?

		- Alright, I’ll find it for you. => END
		- Why should I help you?
			RAPH: Let’s just say… it’s important. More than you know.

	RAPH: Excellent. Now that I have wood and stone, I need something more. Find me some metal.
	- Where can I find metal?

		RAPH: Good. Bring me the bread when it’s ready. => END

if global.bread == true:
	RAPH: You’ve done well… very well. Everything is in place.
	RAPH: Now... are you ready to understand why I needed all these things?

		RAPH: Follow me, then. We’re about to begin a journey you won’t forget. => END
	- No, I think I’m done.
		RAPH: You’ve come this far. But if you truly wish to leave, then go. I won’t stop you. => END
