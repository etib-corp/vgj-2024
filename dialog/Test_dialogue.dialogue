	- What do you need?
		RAPH: Bring me some wood. Just a few logs should do.
		- Alright, I’ll find it for you. => END
		- Why should I help you?
			RAPH: Let’s just say… it’s important. More than you know.
			- Fine, I’ll do it. => END

		RAPH: For reasons you wouldn’t understand... yet.
	- Fine, I’ll get it.
		RAPH: I knew I could count on you. Bring it soon. => END

	- Where can I find metal?
		RAPH: Search the caves or abandoned places. It’ll all make sense soon.
		- Alright, I’ll get it. => END
		- I don’t know if I trust you.

		RAPH: Deadly serious. Bring it to me.
	- What are you planning?
		RAPH: It’s better if you don’t ask. Just bring the wheat. => END

		RAPH: You’ll see soon enough.
	- This is getting strange, but I’ll do it.
		RAPH: Good. Bring me the bread when it’s ready. => END

if global.fifth_step:
	RAPH: You’ve done well… very well. Everything is in place.
	RAPH: Now... are you ready to understand why I needed all these things?
	- Yes, tell me.
		RAPH: Follow me, then. We’re about to begin a journey you won’t forget. => END
	- No, I think I’m done.
		RAPH: You’ve come this far. But if you truly wish to leave, then go. I won’t stop you. => END
