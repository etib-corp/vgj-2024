	RAPH: [[Hi|Hello]]... I need you to do something for me.
	- Who are you?
		RAPH: I'm everything and nothing at the same time. A [[mystery|puzzle]], if you will.
		- Hum, ok, fine.
			RAPH: Good, then. I need you to gather 5 wood logs for me. 
			- Ok, I’ll be back with them soon. => END
			- No, I don’t think I will.
				RAPH: That’s a shame… but the choice is yours. I’ll be here waiting... patiently. => END
	- What do you need?
		RAPH: Just a simple task – bring me 5 wood logs.
		- Alright, I’ll get them for you. => END
		- No, I’m not interested.
			RAPH: How unfortunate. But perhaps you’ll change your mind. I’ll be waiting. => END

if global.given_wood == true:
	RAPH: Perfect… you’re back with the wood. I knew I could count on you.
	RAPH: But now, I need something a bit more... valuable.

	if global.given_silver == false:
		RAPH: This time, I need silver. Think you can manage that?
		- Absolutely not!
			RAPH: Don't play games with me. I'm not one to joke around.
		- Sure, I'll get you the silver.
			RAPH: Excellent. I knew you were someone I could rely on. => END
		- Why do you need all this?
			RAPH: Let’s just say… it’s for a higher purpose. One beyond your understanding.
			- Fine, I’ll get it for you. => END
			- This is getting weird. I’m out.
				RAPH: Oh, but we’re only just beginning. I’ll be waiting for you. => END

	if global.given_silver == true:
		RAPH: Finally, you have everything I asked for. You’ve done well.
		RAPH: Now... are you ready to see what comes next?
		- Yes, show me.
			RAPH: Then follow me. Our journey is just beginning... => END
		- No, I've done enough.
			RAPH: Oh, but there’s always more to do. Come find me if you change your mind. => END
